             </ol>
        <p>"Fit for purpose" ensures that the product is acceptable to whatever you're doing it for. For example my panda website should fit to the purpose of pandas and not sports.</p>
        <p>"Right first time" ensures that everything you do should be correct the first time and not be done over, my code for my site should be right the first time and i shouldn't need to look back due to errors.</p>

                <b>How do web standard relate to web quality?</b>
            </li>
        </ol>

                <b>Describe what Web Accessibility means. What steps you can take to make your pages more accessible?</b>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Web accessibility is the concept that your website should be accesible to all people regardless of disablity, your site should be able to work well and easy for someone who cannot use a mouse or needs a speech reader</p>
        <p>If you wanna make your page more accesible you should think about the disablities some people might have and include a way that helps them rather than create a barrier for them, things like alt text for images, giving links proper names, making sure your content can be viewed without the use of a keyboard things like that should be proper steps ypu should think about when creating your site</p>
