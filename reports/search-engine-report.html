          <dt>How does a search engine work?</dt>
          <dd>Search engines work by looking at the words you typed in to search for, when this happens the search engine will use those terms and look for websites that match the information you searched for</dd>
          <dt>
            Why do different search-engines give different ranking to websites
            for the same search phrase?
          </dt>
          <dd>Search engines vary in what they look for to determine the rank of a site one searh engine will look at the importance of your text while another search engine will look at important keywords in the site, this is why for example google will rank a certain site more higher than another engine like bing</dd>
          <dt>What is a &lt;meta /&gt; tag?</dt>
          <dd>Meta tags are summarized text that lets the search engine know what the site will be about</dd>
          <dt>What is the purpose for Keyword and Description meta tags?</dt>
          <dd>Keyword and Description meta tags help the page by adding a summary of what the site is about under the page, meta descriptions impact a site's click-through-rate that impacts the ranking of the page</dd>
          <dt>Why might you include meta tags in your pages?</dt>
          <dd>meta tags are important to help impact your sites click-through-rate, most people will be more inclined to click on your website and help with rating and traffic.</dd>
          <dt>
            Do meta tags make your pages more easily searchable or improve its
            ranking?
          </dt>
          <dd>Meta tags help do both, adding meta tags will help your site more searchable and will let the user know more about your site without clicking on it yet and when done will they will be more inclined to click which helps with search ranking and the engine will boost it more higher</dd>
          <dt>
            What are several ways that you can publicize your personal website
            project and make it more visible on the web?
          </dt>
          <dd>You can add meta tags that help make your website more easily accesible it would be best to add title, meta and viewport tags to help the accesibility of your site, including a title and meta tag will help the user in what they see in the search process before cliking your link, and adding a viewport tag is good for users who are searching your site through a mobile device which is important now that more users search the web through the phone rather than a laptop or pc.</dd>
