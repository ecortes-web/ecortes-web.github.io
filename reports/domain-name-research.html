    <li><b>What is an internet domain name?</li></b>
       <p> A internet domain name is a set of characters that identify a specific website, the browser will access a domain name server or DNS for short and will find the location of the website through the internet</p>
    <li><b>Why are domain names so important on the web?</li></b>
       <p> Creating a domain name is important so that your website is easily found and isn't lost in cyberspace</p>
    <li><b>Why do domain names have to be unique?</li></b>
       <p> Domain names need to be unique so that your website has that unique feel to it, if your domain ends up being similar or the same to another website people might confuse your website with theirs and would't help your brand stand out from the rest</p>
    <li><b>What does it mean to "register" a domain name?</li></b>
        <p>Registering a domain name means that you become the owner of said name for up to one or many years </p>
    <li><b>If you wanted a domain name that is already taken, how could you get it?</li></b>
       <p> if a domain is already taken in order for you to make it yours you will have to find who owns that domain name and negotioate with them to purchase the domain off them</p>
