 <p align="center" class="home">Pandas one of the more recognizable animals with it's black spots around it's eyes, ears, body and legs are native to the southern part of china.</p>
 <p align="center" class="home">According to discovered fossils it has been determined that giant pandas can date as far back as 8 million years ago. Although it's first discovery in the west was by a hunter who brought panda skin to the french jesult, Armand David in 1869.</p>
 <p align="center" class="home"> Pandas have been an icon in the west and around the world since the first panda made it's way to the zoo in 1972 however due to habitat loss, low birthrates and habitat fragmentation these adorable creatures are starting to become more rare and will one day become extinct if something doesn't change. </p>
